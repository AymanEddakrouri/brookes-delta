Implementation of **Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion (Δ)** for bibliometric analysis and science of science research. This tool quantifies the thematic concentration vs. dispersion of intellectual output in any research domain.

##  What is Brookes' Δ?

Brookes' Δ is a statistical measure ranging from **0 to 1** that answers a critical question in bibliometrics:

- **Δ → 1.0**: High thematic concentration (specialized research)
- **Δ → 0.0**: High thematic dispersion (interdisciplinary research)

The measure was introduced by B.C. Brookes (1977) and provides a single, interpretable metric for comparing the thematic structure across journals, research fields, or institutional outputs.
